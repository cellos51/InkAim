# THIS SOFTWARE IS NOW OBSOLETE [USE THIS INSTEAD](https://github.com/cellos51/CemuInkAim)
Basically Cemu is open source and I made this program obsolete by just making it better and built into a custom cemu version.
I may or may not release the new Cemu version because idk the legality and because I'd have to keep it updated.


# InkAim
A program to play Splatoon on Cemu with a mouse.
